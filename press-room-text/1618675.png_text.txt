NSA Honors Cryptologist Staff
Sergeant Robert Franklin Townsend,
USA

FORT MEADE, Md. —

The National Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) today
honored Cryptologist Staff Sergeant Robert Franklin Townsend, USA, for
his service in the U.S. Army Security Agency's 10" Radio Research
Company during the Vietnam War. Approximately 80 guests, including
military leaders and Sgt. Townsend's family members, attended a wreath-
aying ceremony and tribute at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Md.

Every year since 2001, NSA honors cryptologists who died in service to
he United States. Individual’s names are engraved on NSA/CSS's
Cryptologic Memorial Wall, and their stories are declassified and shared
with family and loved ones in tribute to their service.

During the ceremony, General Paul M. Nakasone, USA, Commander, U.S.
Cyber Command and Director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central
Security Service, expressed NSA‘s gratitude to cryptologists, like Staff
Sergeant Robert Townsend, who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to
our nation.

Born in 1936 in Royal Oak, Mich., Sgt. Townsend joined the U.S. Army
after high school, trained as an infantryman then specialized in
cryptologic work. He served in France and Ethiopia before volunteering to
serve in Vietnam in 1965.

During October 1965, Sgt. Townsend and his fellow officers provided
signals intelligence crucial to the defense of the U.S. Special Forces base
at Plei Me against attacks from Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.

Afterward, as U.S. 1st Cavalry Division helicopters pursued retreating
North Vietnamese forces, Sgt. Townsend's unit warned that the enemy
force was possibly much larger than anticipated. The ensuing battle
launched the first major confrontation between U.S. and North
Vietnamese armies, the battle of la Drang.

On November 4, 1965, Sgt. Townsend was killed by an enemy sniper
while trying to protect his fellow soldiers. He was survived by his wife,
Mary (deceased), and three children, Richard (deceased), Katheryn, and
Dan.

Sgt. Townsend's name was engraved on NSA's Cryptologic Memorial
Wall during its dedication in 1996. Today, the wall displays the names of
176 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine and civilian cryptologists who have
died in service to their country since World War II. To learn more about
Sgt. Townsend, please read his profile.
