Appointment of NSA’s First
Transparency Officer

FORT MEADE, Md. —

Rebecca Richards, NSA's Director of Civil Liberties and Privacy, has been
appointed to serve concurrently as the Agency's first Transparency
Officer. This dual role complements ongoing initiatives to ensure that
SA has the best civil liberties and privacy practices.

The appointment reflects NSA’s commitment to the Principles o
ntelligence Transparency for the Intelligence Community (IC) which were
ecently established by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
in conjunction with IC agencies. The principles support making
information publicly available in a way that enhances understanding of
intelligence activities, while continuing to protect information when
disclosure would harm national security. You can view the Principles at
www.dni.gov.

As the NSA Transparency Officer, Ms. Richards will serve on the ODNI-led
ntelligence Transparency Council, anew forum where the IC will develop
a strategic, coordinated, and proactive approach to increased
ransparency. This approach will include not only sharing information
about the rules that apply to the IC and its compliance under those rules,
but also sharing information about what the IC does in pursuit of its
national security mission, while at the same time protecting vital
intelligence sources, methods, and activities.
