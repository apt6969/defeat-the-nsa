NSA Moves Forward with Reformed
Acquisition Program

On 8 November 2000, the National Security Agency successfully
accomplished its initial acquisition milestone under its new acquisition
program, and released a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) to industry for
concept studies. NSA's ongoing acquisition reform is the result of
Director Lt Gen Michael V. Hayden's transformation efforts to improve
and modernize NSA into the 21st century and continue its long tradition
of preserving national security for the United States.

This milestone was accomplished when a newly-formed NSA Acquisition
Review Board met and approved an acquisition program for concept
studies for TRAILBLAZER, which is one of NSAâ€™s major SIGINT
modernization programs. These studies will explore, identify and produce

system concepts and architectures for the TRAILBLAZER initiative.

This heightened level of acquisition discipline is the result of guidance
rom the NSA Senior Acquisition Executive office, headed by Mr. Harry D.
Gatanas. The new review process included broad representation from the
ntelligence Community and Defense, including senior members from the
staff of the Director of Central Intelligence, the Assistant Secretary for
Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD C3l), and
epresentation from the Military Service Cryptologic Elements, in addition
o the key components from within NSA.

A draft Request for Proposal for concept studies was released for
comment earlier this month. NSA plans to award up to three study
contracts in February 2001.
