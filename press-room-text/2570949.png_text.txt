LPS Qubit Collaboratory

PRESS RELEASE | April 13, 2021

NSA Launches LPS Qubit
Collaboratory

Today the National Security Agency's Laboratory for Physical Sciences
(LPS) launched the LPS Qubit Collaboratory (LQC), a Quantum
Information Science research center in support of the U.S. National
Quantum Initiative. The LQC offers a mechanism for collaborative
research between LPS and academia, industry, FFRDCs, and Government
Laboratories. The mission of the LQC is to:

e Pursue disruptive fundamental research and enabling technologies
with a focus on qubit development for quantum computing and other
applications (such as sensing);

¢ Build a quantum workforce through research experiences and
innovative training in government at LPS and at LQC partners; and

¢ Grow deep, collaborative partnerships to tackle the most difficult and
relevant long-term problems for quantum information science and
technology.

The Army Research Office, in partnership with LPS, has announced a
Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the LPS Qubit Collaboratory that
introduces the initial research areas of the LQC. The BAA solicits
proposals for partnerships with outside institutions allowing researchers
O pursue joint research with LPS, use shared lab spaces, and interact
with other collaborators across academia, government, and industry. The
BAA also creates a new Quantum Computing Research (QUACR
Fellowship program for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers
across the country. “The National Security Agency is committed to
raining the next generation of scientists and engineers, and the LQC will
continue LPS' long tradition of driving research in future information
echnologies,” said Dr. Barry Barker, Director of the Laboratory fo
Physical Sciences.

Organizations interested in partnership opportunities should contact the
LQC at qubitcollaboratory.org and view the ARO/LQC Broad Agency
Announcement here.
