NSA releases Cybersecurity
Advisory on GRUB2 BootHole
Vulnerability

NSA

FT. MEADE, Md. -

Thursday ona vulnerability (CVE-2020-10713) known as BootHole that
poses a risk to a majority of Linux distributions and systems running on
Windows 8 or later versions. That includes those on National Security
Systems, Department of Defense (DoD) systems, as well as the Defense
Industrial Base (DIB). First disclosed by Eclypsium on Wednesday, the
vulnerability affects the Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB2) widely used to

boot Linux-based operating systems.

The vulnerability enables bypass of Secure Boot — used to control which
software can boot on a device through signature validation — to gain
arbitrary code execution and compromise the integrity of the boot
process even when Secure Boot is enabled. It could be used to install
persistent and stealthy bootkits that operate even when Secure Boot is
enabled and functioning correctly. Due to an issue in parsing GRUB
configuration files, an attacker can execute arbitrary code to bypass
signature verification.

While Windows does not use GRUB, the fact that Unified Extensible
Firmware Interface (UEFI)-based computers ‘trust’ the vulnerable version
of GRUB makes it possible for a Windows boot process to be
compromised by this vulnerability. Impact may include but is not limited
to public/private cloud instances, data center servers, end-user
desktops/laptops, and Linux-based Operational Technology/Internet of
Things devices.

n “Mitigate the GRUB2 BootHole Vulnerability,” NSA provides
administrators with two mitigation options. The standard mitigation,
which involves updating an endpoint’s boot components and revoking the
rust of existing vulnerable boot components, will mitigate the
vulnerability in consumer, business and enterprise environments.

SA plans to release a Cybersecurity Technical Report on “UEFI| Secure
Boot Customization” soon that will provide comprehensive guidance on
how to tackle the advanced mitigation offered in the Cybersecurity
Advisory. The advanced mitigation is best suited for endpoints that have
higher security and integrity requirements.
