Cyber Defense Put to the Test
During Annual Exercise

The National Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS),
Information Assurance Directorate will test information assurance
professionals from the five U.S. service academies, the Naval
Postgraduate School, the Air Force Institute of Technology, and the Royal
Military College of Canada during the 10th Annual Cyber Defense
Exercise (CDX) 20-23 April 2010. Teams from the U.S. Air Force Academy,
U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, U.S. Naval
Academy, and West Point will compete to win the coveted CDX trophy.
The exercise will be run in Lockheed Martin spaces at 7615 Ora Glen
Avenue, Greenbelt, MD.

e Journalists interested in covering the event are invited to attend from
10:00 am to 12:00 pm on Thursday, 22 April 2010 and must reply to
this e-mail or call the NSA Public and Media Affairs Office at (301) 688-
6524 by 21 April 2010.

e The NSA/CSS Information Assurance Directorate sponsors this annual
event.

Â¢ Cameras are not permitted on the premises, but photographs will be
provided to media representatives who attend the CDX.

During the CDX exercise, network specialists tasked with securing the
U.S. Government's most sensitive communication systems will challenge
Service Academy teams in their ability to defend computer networks the
students have designed, built and configured at their respective schools.
The entire CDX is conducted on virtual private networks, providing a safe
path for the exercise while preventing interference with real-world
networks. A separate group of specialists will grade each team's ability to
effectively maintain network services while detecting, responding to, and
ecovering from network security intrusions or compromises.

For more information about participating in the 2010 CDX Media Day,
