Hunting Russian Intelligence
“Snake” Malware

CYBERSECURITY ADVISORY

PRESS RELEASE | May 9, 2023

U.S. Agencies and Allies Partner to
Identify Russian Snake Malware
Infrastructure Worldwide

FORT MEADE, Mad. - The National Security Agency (NSA) and several
partner agencies have identified infrastructure for Snake malware—a
sophisticated Russian cyberespionage tool—in over 50 countries

worldwide.

To assist network defenders in detecting Snake and any associated
activity, the agencies are publicly releasing the joint Cybersecurity
Advisory (CSA), “Hunting Russian Intelligence “Snake” Malware” today.

The agencies, which include the NSA, Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Cyber
National Mission Force (CNMF), Canadian Cyber Security Centre (CCCS),
United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-Uk), Australian
Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), and New Zealand National Cyber Security
Centre (NCSC-NZ) attribute Snake operations to a known unit within
Center 16 of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). The internationa
coalition has identified Snake malware infrastructure across North
America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, including the
United States and Russia.

“Russian government actors have used this tool for years for intelligence
collection,’ said Rob Joyce, NSA Director of Cybersecurity. “Snake
infrastructure has spread around the world. The technical details will help
many organizations find and shut down the malware globally.”

alicious cyber actors used Snake to access and exfiltrate sensitive
international relations documents, as well as other diplomatic
communications, through a victim in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization
NATO) country.

nthe U.S., the FSB has victimized industries including education
institutions, small businesses, and media organizations. Critical
infrastructure sectors, such as local government, finance, manufacturing,
and telecommunications, have also been impacted.

Typically, Snake malware is deployed to external-facing infrastructure
nodes on a network. From there, it uses other tools, and techniques,
tactics, and procedures (TTPs) on the internal network to conduct
additional exploitation operations.

This CSA focuses on one of the more recent variants of Snake. It
provides background on Snake's attribution to the FSB and detailed
technical information and mitigation recommendations to assist network
defenders in protecting against Snake-associated malicious activity.
