PRESS RELEASE | April 19, 2023

NSA Part of Coalition Highlighting
Cybersecurity Best Practices for
Smart Cities

FORT MEADE, Md. - The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) are partnering with international partners’
cybersecurity agencies to publish cybersecurity best practices for smart
cities, which integrate public services into a connected environment to
increase efficiencies and improve the quality of life in various
communities.

Seven agencies from five countries has published the Cybersecurity
Information Sheet, “Cybersecurity Best Practices for Smart Cities,”
highlighting how the integration of operational technology into a
connected environment has many benefits, but can also be an attractive
target for malicious cyber actors to steal critical infrastructure data and
proprietary information, conduct ransomware operations, or launch
destructive cyberattacks.

The report examines risks deriving from three areas: a large
interconnected attack surface, the ICT supply chain and vendors, and the
automation of infrastructure operations.

The authoring agencies also provide recommendations to help
organizations balance efficiency and innovation with cybersecurity,
privacy protections, and national security. They recommend that
organizations implement these best practices to ensure the safe and
secure operation of infrastructure systems, protection of citizens’ private
data, and security of sensitive government and business data.
