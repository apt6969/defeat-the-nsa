NSA Releases Cybersecurity
Technical Report on UEFI Secure
Boot Customization
NSA

WASHINGTON —
The National Security Agency has released a UEFI Secure Boot
Customization Cybersecurity Technical Report that provides detailed
recommendations for customizing Secure Boot to better protect against
firmware exploitation - a means attackers can use to gain persistent
access to victim networks.

Secure Boot customization enables administrators to realize the benefits
of boot malware defenses, insider threat mitigations, and data-at-rest
protections. This product encourages National Security System (NSS),
Department of Defense (DoD), and Defense Industrial Base (DIB) system
administrators to customize Secure Boot instead of disabling it for
compatibility issues.

This product follows NSA‘s 30 July advisory release on the
GRUB BootHole vulnerability and is published as part of NSA’s mission to
help secure NSS, DoD, and DIB systems.

The full product can be viewed here.
