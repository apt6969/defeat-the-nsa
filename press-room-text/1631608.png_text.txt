West Point Takes the NSA Cyber
Defense Trophy for the Third
Straight Year

The National Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) is
pleased to announce that the United States Military Academy at West
Point has won the 2009 Cyber Defense Exercise (CDX) trophy for the third
year in a row. CDX, an annual event that is sponsored by NSA/CSS, is a
computer security competition designed to foster education and
awareness among future military leaders about the role of information
assurance (IA).

During the CDX, NSA/CSS network specialists challenged teams in their
abilities to defend the closed computer networks that the students had
designed, built and configured at their respective schools. The entire CDX
is conducted on virtual private networks, providing a safe path for the
exercise without interference to real-world networks. The students were
graded on each team's ability to effectively maintain network services
while they detected, responded to, and recovered from network security
intrusions or compromises.

Teams from the U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S.
erchant Marine Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, and West Point
participated at their respective schools. Also participating was the Air
Force Institute of Technology, the Naval Postgraduate School and, for the
first time, an allied partner school - the Royal Military College of Canada.
