CYBERSECURITY ADVISORY

PRESS RELEASE | April 18, 2023

NCSC-UK, NSA, and Partners Advise
about APT28 Exploitation of Cisco
Routers

FORT MEADE, Md. - The National Security Agency (NSA) has partnered
with the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA) to publish a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) report on
the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with APT28’s
exploitation of Cisco routers.

APT28 is also known as the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence
Directorate (GRU) 85th Special Service Center (GTsSS) military
intelligence unit 26165, Fancy Bear, STRONTIUM, Pawn Storm, the Sednit
Gang, and Sofacy.

The transatlantic coalition published the “APT28 exploits known
ulnerability to carry out reconnaissance and deploy malware on Cisco
routers” CSA indicating that APT28 cyber actors masqueraded Simple
etwork Management protocol (SNMP) to exploit CVE-2017-6742 (

) and access vulnerable Cisco routers worldwide.
This included U.S. Government institutions, approximately 250 Ukrainian
ictims, and a small number based in Europe.

These cyber actors continue to leverage a known vulnerability to exploit
unpatched Cisco routers to conduct reconnaissance and deploy malware
to enable unauthenticated access.

SNMP is designed to allow administrators to monitor and configure
network devices remotely, but it can also be misused to obtain sensitive
network information and, if vulnerable, exploit devices to penetrate a
network.

The authoring agencies recommend following the mitigation advice to
defend against this malicious activity and identify indicators of
compromise (loCs) to detect possible activity in networks.
