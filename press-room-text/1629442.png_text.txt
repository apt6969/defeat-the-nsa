National Security Agency Debut
Friedman Collection and the
Declassification and Release of
William Friedman's Official Papers

William F. Friedman is one of the founders of American cryptology, the

of cryptology, Friedman's career highlights many great achievements. As
he lead code breaker for the U.S. War Department, he led a team that
broke Japanese diplomatic code in 1940 during World War Il. As a result,
General Marshall later described the intelligence provided by Friedman
and his cryptologists as "contributing greatly to the victory and
remendously to the saving of American lives...and...the early termination
of the war."

When Friedman retired from NSA in 1955, he donated his personal
papers to the Marshall Foundation where they have resided since 1969.
With the addition of these official papers, the Marshall Foundation now
possesses the most complete and comprehensive set of Friedman
materials as part of one of the most private collections of cryptologic
material worldwide.

arshall Foundation, NSA, the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA), and scholars and historians, highlighting the
value of Friedman's efforts and the significance of this release. It also
eatured a panel presentation that detailed the efforts taken to declassify
and release 7,600 documents. Photos and information about the release
