National Security Agency to Hold
Career Expos in Georgia and South
Carolina

The National Security Agency (NSA) will hold career expos in Georgia and
South Carolina this month as part of its drive to hire approximately 1,500
people enterprise-wide every year through 2008. NSA is holding these
expos away from its Ft. Meade, Maryland, campus to widen its reach for
top talent and to highlight areas other than its headquarters where some
of the new hires will be assigned. Subsequent expos will be held in Texas
and Hawaii.

SA recruiters will be in Columbia, South Carolina, on March 15; in
Atlanta on March 16; and in Augusta, on March 17, 2005. NSA is hiring
intelligence analysts, language analysts, computer scientists,
computer/electrical engineers, mathematicians, signals analysts,
cryptanalysts, accountants, budget/financial analysts, investigators, and
police officers.

SA is continuing to develop a global cryptologic enterprise that is
esilient, agile, and effective in prosecuting a dynamic target/threat
environment. By way of these career expos, it hopes to reach out and
attract the best and the brightest that the nation has to offer in support of
SA’s mission and improve NSA‘s capabilities to continue to provide
critical intelligence to policymakers and war fighters.
