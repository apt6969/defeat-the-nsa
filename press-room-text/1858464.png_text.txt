NSA/CSS Memorial Day
Observance Honors Cryptologic
Heroes, Past and Present

FT MEADE, Md. -
On 28 May 2019, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, director of the National
Security Agency/chief, Central Security Service honored the service and
sacrifice of Staff Sergeant Donald D. Daugherty, USA, during the Agency's
annual Memorial Day Observance.

SSG Daugherty was a member of the Army Security Agency (ASA) 3rd
Radio Research Unit (RRU). The U.S. Army had employed cryptologic
specialists operating under the RRU cover designation to collect critical
intelligence from enemy communications used to help our military win
battles and save lives.

On 13 April 1966, at Tan Son Nhut airfield, just west of Saigon, where SSG
Daugherty was stationed, was subjected to a deadly Viet Cong mortar
and sapper attack. At one point, the shelling temporarily abated,
prompting SSG Daugherty to inform his fellow soldiers that he intended
o make his way to the arms room to get his hands on a weapon. As SSG
Daugherty began running toward the armory, the attack suddenly
esumed, and SSG Daugherty was felled when a mortar shell struck the
sidewalk directly in front of him.

Daughertyâ€™s name is engraved on the NSA/CSS Cryptologic Memorial
Wall along with 177 others from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, and
civilian cryptologists who have made the ultimate sacrifice, "serving in
silence, in the performance of their duties since World War Il. The
ceremony included a traditional wreath laying and was attended by
riends and distinguished guests.

Additional information on the Memorial Wall and a special historical
monograph highlighting SGT Daugherty live, service, and sacrifice can be

viewed via the NSA/CSS web site.

ceremony or additional information should contact the NSA Media
