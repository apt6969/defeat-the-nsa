CYBERSECURITY ADVISORY

PRESS RELEASE | May 17, 2022

NSA, Allies Issue Cybersecurity
Advisory on Weaknesses that Allow
Initial Access

FORT MEADE, Md. — The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the FBI, along
with allied nations, published a Cybersecurity Advisory today to raise
awareness about the poor security configurations, weak controls and
other poor network hygiene practices malicious cyber actors use to gain
initial access to a victim's system.

"also includes best practices that can help organizations
strengthen their defenses against this malicious activity.

“AS long as these security holes exist, malicious cyber actors will
continue to exploit them,” said NSA Cybersecurity Director Rob Joyce.
“We encourage everyone to mitigate these weaknesses by implementing
the recommended best practices.”

Some of the most common weaknesses include not enforcing
multifactor authentication, incorrectly applying privileges or permissions
and errors within access control lists and not keeping software up to
date. The advisory recommends mitigations that control access, harden
credentials, establish centralized log management and more.

CISA produced the advisory with help from NSA and other partners. That
includes the FBI, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the New
Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ) and Computer
Emergency Response Team (CERT NZ), the Netherlands National Cyber
Security Centre (NCSC-NL), and the United Kingdom National Cyber
Security Centre (NCSC-UK) on the advisory. Many of the same
cybersecurity authorities collaborated to release a complementary
advisory on 27 April, which highlighted the top routinely exploited
vulnerabilities from 2021.
