NSA Goes "Greener,' Leads the
Nation in Recycling Ceiling Tiles

FORT MEADE, Md. â€”

The National Security Agency (NSA) was recognized by Armstrong World
ndustries (AWI) on December 18 for being the nation's leader in recycling
ceiling tiles. NSA started recycling ceiling tiles in September 2008 and
processed more than 400,000 ceiling tiles by November 2009.

SA also adopted the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
LEED) guidelines as part of its "NSA Goes Green" program. These efforts
help the Agency improve its buildings, making them more efficient on the
inside for its workers and more environmentally friendly on the outside
or the community. NSA's ever-growing "green" program includes
ecycling ceiling tiles and other materials, improving its buildings, and

adding fuel efficient cars to its fleet of government vehicles.

According to AWI, recycling 400,000 square feet of ceiling tiles is
equivalent to diverting 400,000 pounds of waste from landfills or saving
278,000 kilowatt hours of energy. As one of the largest employers in
Maryland, NSA takes its responsibility to be a good neighbor and
environmentally sound very seriously.
