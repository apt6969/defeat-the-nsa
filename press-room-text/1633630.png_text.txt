Air Force Academy Captures NSA
Cyber Defense Competition Honors

FORT GEORGE G. MEADE, Md. -

The Air Force Academy snatched top honors among U.S. Service
Academies that recently competed in the National Security Agency-
sponsored Cyber Defense Exercise (CDX), April 10-14 2006. Though the
op score was in actuality earned by a team of savvy graduate students
rom the Air Force Institute of Technology who participated on a graded,
but non-competitive basis, the Cadets of the Air Force Academy were the
ecipients of the formal competitive honors among participating service
academy teams that also included the Army, Navy, Coast Guard and
erchant Marine.

The 6th annual exercise pitted teams of future military leaders
epresenting the Air Force, Army, Navy, Coast Guard and Merchant

arine service academies against highly skilled NSA and military
network experts who sought to expose network vulnerabilities and exploit
weaknesses in order to raise awareness about the critical importance of
strong information assurance practices.

This year, the NSA heightened the challenge even before the competition
had commenced by providing each team with software that had been
pre-configured with known vulnerabilities. Each team was then expected
to conduct a forensic analysis of the software to root out potential
problems that might later threaten the security and performance of their
networks.

Runner-up honors went this year to the cadets of West Point, followed in
third place by last year's winner, the U.S. Naval Academy. The Coast
Guard and Merchant Marine teams finished fourth and fifth place
respectively.

The NSAâ€˜s Information Assurance Director, Dick Schaeffer, who
announced the winner in a conference call to academies on April 21, is
scheduled to visit the academy soon to award the coveted Information
Assurance Trophy to the Air Force's Falcon team.

"This was one incredible team effort, from the red cell to the cadets and
midshipmen who participated, but the real beneficiaries are the soldiers,
sailors, airmen and Marines who are on the tip of the spear that support
the network and depend on it," he concluded.

the victory, or contact Ken White, NSA Public Affairs, at (301) 688-6524.
