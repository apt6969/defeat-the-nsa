NSA Recommends Adobe Acrobat
Reader Security Configurations

FORT MEADE, Md. — The National Security Agency (NSA) released

today. The technical report addresses the
ongstanding issue of cyber actors using malicious PDFs when targeting
victim networks. Specifically, it details recommended Adobe Reader
configuration settings for systems administrators to help minimize the
isk of executable content and other malicious activity ina Windows
environment.

SA recommends administrators implement modern security features
or sandboxing and access control — configurations that can be rolled
across networks to limit this common access vector at scale. Also
included in the report is guidance for those who only need the basic
viewing function for PDFs in addition to more complex uses, such as
data sharing.

Administrators are encouraged to carefully review this document to
select configuration options that will have minimal impact on usability
while providing maximum protection for their organizations.
