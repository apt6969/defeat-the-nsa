Release of Documents Related to
Vietnam War POW/MIA Cases

FORT MEADE, Md. - The National Security Agency / Central Security Service
(NSA/CSS) will release 1,600 declassified documents related to the agency's
support to Vietnam War Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) cases.
These documents will be released in a series with the first 170 documents now
available on nsa.gov. The publication of these documents supports NSA's
commitment to increased transparency.
The documents consist of NSA intelligence reports, memoranda and
notes by NSA analysts that were directly or potentially related to
incidents where a member of the U.S. military was known to have been
aken prisoner or declared MIA. The Agency completed three "Correlation
Studies" for the Senate Select Committee on Vietnam POW/MIA Affairs
hroughout the 1990s, beginning in 1992 and ending in 1996. These
udies were released on nsa.gov in September 2014. The continuing
eed to protect information contained in the documents which remains
properly classified required a small number of redactions to the
information.

The documents NSA released demonstrate how we contributed to U.S.
Government efforts to locate service members taken prisoner o
declared missing during the Vietnam conflict,’ said David J. Sherman,
Associate Director of Policy and Records. "NSA continues to support

similar activities on behalf of Americans and others held against their
will.”

ow, the entire archive of releasable material related to Vietnam
POW/MIA issues will be available in a single location on nsa.gov as a
service to family members, historians and the general public. Some of
hese documents were released previously in response to Freedom of
nformation Act (FOIA) requests.

SA/CSS believes the current series of releases represents a
comprehensive set of all relevant NSA documents in its holdings of
historical materials. If additional POW/MIA documents are discovered,
SA/CSS remains committed to reviewing the material to determine the
potential for release and posting on nsa.gov.
