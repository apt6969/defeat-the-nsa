The NCM opened its doors in July 1993 for the National Security Agency
workforce. For five months, it built and trained its staff on conducting
tours, acquired and set up displays so that it would be ready to open to
the public in December that year, when it became the first public
museum in the Intelligence Community. Since then, the NCM has
educated hundreds of thousands of visitors about the history of
cryptology, the people who devoted their lives to the profession, and
devices they made to keep our nation safe.

The NCM is located off Exit 10A on Maryland Route 32 near the
Baltimore-Washington Parkway (I-295), adjacent to the headquarters of
the National Security Agency. For more information on the museum,
tours, educational programs, and hours and days of operation, visit the
National Cryptologic Museum web page on NSA.gov. More information
about the museum and this event is also available at the National
Cryptologic Museum's Facebook page at
