PRESS RELEASE | May 29, 2014

Statement in response to recent
allegations regarding contact with
the NSA Office of General Counsel

NSA has now explained that they have found one email inquiry by Edward
Snowden to the Office of General Counsel asking for an explanation of
some material that was in a training course he had just completed. The
e-mail did not raise allegations or concerns about wrongdoing or abuse,
but posed a legal question that the Office of General Counsel addressed.
There was not additional follow-up noted. The e-mail will be released later
today,

There are numerous avenues that Mr. Snowden could have used to raise
other concerns or whistleblower allegations. We have searched for
additional indications of outreach from him in those areas and to date
have not discovered any engagements related to his claims.
