NSA Develops INFOSEC
Assessment Training and Rating
Program

The National Security Agency has developed a new evaluation program,
for the benefit of government and industry organizations seeking to
improve the INFOSEC posture of their information systems and
networks. This program, called the INFOSEC Assessment Training and
Rating Program (IATRP) seeks to connect organizations in need of
Information Technology vulnerability assessments with companies
qualified to perform such assessments within the quality guidelines and
standards defined by the program.

Seven companies agreed to have their INFOSEC vulnerability assessment
capability appraised against NSA's INFOSEC Assessment Capability
Maturity Model. All seven companies perform assessments using either
the NSA-developed INFOSEC Assessment Methodology (IAM) or a
similar assessment methodology. The participating companies include:

e Backbone Security.com;

¢ Booz-Allen & Hamilton;

¢ Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC);
¢ Electronic Data Systems (EDS);

e Lucent Technologies;

e SRA International; and,

¢ TrustWave (formerly NetSafe).

The long-term goal of the I|ATRP is to assist in the protection of sensitive
information by increasing the information assurance levels of our
National and Defense Information Infrastructures. The program will also
enable compliance with the Presidential Decision Directive-63 (PDD-63)
requirements for Vulnerability Assessments.

As the name implies, the IATRP has both training and rating components.
The training portion of the program provides a standardized INFOSEC
Assessment Methodology (IAM) to commercial service providers and
government personnel. The rating portion of the program assigns a
series of ratings to commercial assessment providers so that customers
can judge whether a provider is capable of meeting its requirements. For
