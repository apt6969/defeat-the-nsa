CYBERSECURITY ADVISORY

PRESS RELEASE | Feb. 9, 2023

U.S., South Korean Agencies
Partner to #StopRansomware
Threat from DPRK

FORT MEADE, Md. — The National Security Agency (NSA) partnered with U.S.
and South Korean government agencies to

about the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
ransomware threat.

The "

" advisory shares recently observed tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by DPRK cyber actors in ransomware
attacks against the U.S. and South Korean healthcare systems, as well as other
critical infrastructure. The report also includes mitigations to help organizations
protect against the ransomware threat.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal
Bureau of Investigations (FBI), the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), and the Republic of Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS)
and Defense Security Agency (DSA) joined the NSA in releasing this new
advisory. The report is part of the #StopRansomware effort to counter this
ongoing threat and updates the joint CISA, FBI, and U.S. Department of
Treasury Cybersecurity Advisory released in July, "North Korean State-
Sponsored Cyber Actors Use Maui Ransomware to Target the Healthcare and
Public Health Sector."

DPRK cyber actors have been using cryptocurrency generated through illicit
cybercrime activities to procure infrastructure such as IP addresses and
domains. The actors intend to conceal their affiliation and then exploit common
vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) in order to gain access and escalate
privileges on targeted networks to perform ransomware activities.

Recently observed CVEs include remote code execution in the Apache Log4j
software library (also Known as "Log4Shell") and remote code execution in
various SonicWall appliances.

NSA and the other authoring agencies urge all critical infrastructure entities and

organizations, including the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector, and the
Department of Defense and Defense Industrial Base, to apply the mitigations
