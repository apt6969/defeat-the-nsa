PRESS RELEASE | Feb. 18, 2022

Georgia Institute of Technology
wins the 2021 NSA Codebreaker
Challenge

FORT MEADE, Md. â€” Today, the National Security Agency announced
Georgia Institute of Technology, University of North Georgia and Oregon
State University as the first, second and third place winners of the 2021
SA Codebreaker Challenge (CBC). CBC is an annual cryptanalysis and
everse engineering challenge that is open to students at U.S.-based
academic institutions. Each year the challenge offers students a realistic,
SA mission-centric scenario that typifies the work that NSA performs
daily in its role defending of the Nation.

nitially launched in 2013 with five participating schools, this year's CBC
hosted participants from 631 academic institutions. The 2021 challenge
involved a fictitious compromise to the Defense Industrial Base's
network, which NSA helps to defend. Over the course of the challenge,
students worked to identify the scope of the fictitious compromise,
analyze the malicious actor's tradecraft and protocol and worked to gain
access to the malicious actor's infrastructure in an effort to uncover
additional details about the actor's activities.

During the challenge, participants worked independently to solve
increasingly complex tasks. NSA provided direction and tips through
virtual exchanges that shared tools and concepts to help solve the
increasingly difficult tasks. Only 42 of the CBC's 5,464 participants
completed the entire challenge within the allotted timeframe.

Pamela Jock, NSA's Chief of Academic Engagement stated that "the CBC
has led to increased interest in cybersecurity careers at NSA and
influenced cyber education curriculums at a few schools who have
incorporated CBC into their Fall courses. This collaboration has the
potential of sharpening individual cyber student skill sets as well as
strengthening the rigor of cyber education programs nationally. "

SA congratulates the solvers, winning schools, top performers, and all
participants of the 2021 Codebreaker Challenge. The 2021 Codebreaker
Challenge ran from 2 August 2021 through 4 January 2022. For more
